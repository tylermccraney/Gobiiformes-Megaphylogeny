# This script runs several programs that download goby DNA sequences from GenBank, 
# produces alignments, estimates a phylogeny, and plots tree.


# Program 1 - PHLAWD
# I need a file containing DNA sequences of several different genes from gobies in fasta 
# format e.g., 12s, 16s, cytB, cox1, nad1, nad2, rag2, etc. (knownfile)

# Begin by making configuration files for each gene in 'knownfile'
    # Write python program that searches knownfile for gene name and writes it in config-
    # uration files
        # Loop through knownfile line-by-line
            # find gene names delimited by '>'
                # Write gene names to each configuration file

# Use subprocess program to run PHLAWD program
    # Specify knownfile and configuration files
        # PHLAWD searches GenBank for goby sequences
            # MUSCLE alignment program is implemented in PHLAWD
                # Multiple sequence alignment file is output


# Program 2 - RAxML or MrBayes
# This step takes alignment file as input and estimates a phylogeny by either ML or Bayes-
# ian method

# Use subprocess program to run RAxML or MrBayes
    # Outputs a tree file
    

# Program 3 - Plot phylogeny in R
# This part takes the tree file as input and produces a beautiful phylogenetic tree.
